HelloJava

This is my first java program, which implements a senorial where given a light matrix and a sequence of commands. Where each command consturct the matrix to do a series of jobs. At the end of the program, number of odd light column is outputed. The command are excuted as follows.

> * 对每一盏灯的操作都是使其状态反转；
> * 如果自上往下，则上面一行的某盏灯的反转会触发下一行中一盏（恰好一盏）灯的反转；如果自下向上，则下面一行的某盏灯的反转会触发上一行中一盏（恰好一盏）灯的反转；
> * 施加一个反转序列的操作会影响所有的行，每行只反转一盏灯；
> * 多米诺光控灯阵列可以生成一行摘要信息，这行摘要信息也是一行灯，灯的灭与亮是由这列上所有灯的状态决定的。如果相应列上的亮灯总数是奇数，则指示灯是亮的；如果相应列上亮灯总数是偶数，则指示灯灭的。
> * 最后要输出指示灯亮的总数量。

Inorder to compress the matrix into the 200MB memory limit, we use a Long Int to represent a row.

Actually there is a better way to solve the first problem.

As each turn will change the parity of each column, we simply needs a LongInt to track the parity of each column. Where the F dosen't matter as well.

This is interesting. When extending an class, when constructing an father pointer, and points it to its inheritance, it calls the variable of father and method of son.
